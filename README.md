#README.md

##Introduction

This repo contains my personal emacs configuration. I've used it on various
versions of Linux (Centos 6.4, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and on OSX 10.9.  I don't
guarantee it will work for you or that you will like it.  You're really best
off browsing the files and incorporating what you want into your own emacs
config.

##Usage

Clone this repo to your home directory and rename the project directory to
~/.emacs.d and you should be set to go.
